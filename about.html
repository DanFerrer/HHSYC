            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
            <p>The Hip-Hop Summit Youth Council (“HHSYC”) was founded by its Chairman Charles Fisher in July of 2001.
                The organization was created to help implement the commitments, guidelines and policies made by
                record companies, artists, community leaders and elected officials at the June 12-13, 2001 Hip-Hop Summit
                at the Hilton Hotel in New York. After attending the historic and successful "closed door" event and sitting
                on its Youth panel, Charles felt a genuine need to establish an Advocacy group that would work towards
                meeting Hip-Hop's most important challenges, which are to improve the image and unity within the Hip-Hop culture;
                show our participants how to constructively use their time, talent and the Hip-Hop culture to improve
                social, political and economic conditions in their school, home and community.
            </p> <br />

            <p>Randy Fisher has served as the executive director since 2002 and has provided a ‘hands on’ approach to the
                needs and aspirations of the youth and young adults. As a 28-year-old seasoned executive he plays a duel
                role towards fulfilling the organization’s mission. He has to work in the trenches to earn the respect of
                young people, but also meet with elected officials, corporate, community, clergy, school staff and community
                leaders to address their many needs. Over the years he has earned the loyalty of our youth and young adults
                by communicating with them on a level they can understand and being there for them when the going gets tough.
                As their trusted representative he has the experience and professional skills to bridge the communication
                gap between our youth and adults so both can work to improve communities nationwide. The multi-billion
                dollar Hip-Hop industry is the greatest international cultural phenomenon ever created. It transcends all
                racial, ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds and is the way of life for our youth and young adults.
                With all the negativity surrounding Hip-Hop many are unaware that Love; Respect; Peace and Unity are the
                forgotten characteristics that gave birth to its four basic pillars which include: DJ’ing; MC’ing; Breakdancing;
                and Graffiti. Collectively, they are the Body & Soul of the culture. We have established Chapters in schools and
                communities across the country through the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents 66 cities
                and districts and 7.5 million public school students nationwide, as well as a host of other private and
                government agencies. This strategic alliance coupled with the clout of the Hip-Hop industry gives us
                the foundation to truly make a difference.
            </p> <br />

            <p>America is the greatest country on earth, but is built on a culture that glorifies sex, drugs, guns and
                violence. Each has contributed to the decay of our youth and young adults. With Hip-Hop now being taught
                in schools and universities throughout the country we will use it as an educational tool to teach participants
                about Drugs, Guns, Gang Violence, HIV/AIDS, Character Education, Politics, Economics and a host of other issues.
            </p> <br />

            <p>Celebrities, Professional Athletes, Politicians, Executives, Clergy, Law Enforcement Officers, Community
                Leaders and Ex-offenders will work together to reinforce the goals of each project and provide prizes and
                incentives to participants. Our goal is to “Flip the Script” and start a new trend that uses Hip-Hop to encourage
                our participants to graduate from school; improve their character; obtain meaningful employment; pursue
                their Entrepreneurial goals; fulfill their civic duty; and avoid the criminal justice system. As the
                "Raptivism Movement" grows stronger we will continue to use Hip-Hop as a vehicle to build a movement that works
                for the safety and positive development of young people
            </p> <br />

            <h2 id="mission">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>The Mission of the Hip-Hop Summit Youth Council (“HHSYC”) is to work as an advocacy group to protect the
                rights, interest and future of our youths and young adults while addressing a host of issues that confront
                them daily. By partnering with schools, the entertainment industry, private and government agencies we have
                created a unique network that provides the resources to help young people fulfill their social and academic
                goals. Through the use of Hip-Hop we have bridged the communication gap between our youth and adults and
                have earned the trust and respect of both.
            </p> <br />

            <p>As the Multi-Billion dollar Hip-Hop Culture grows stronger, so does the "Raptivism Movement." It represents
                the New Social Message behind the Hip-Hop culture. As we grow as a company Parents, Artists, Executives,
                Politicians, Clergy, Businessmen and Community Leaders continue to support our work to use Hip-Hop as a tool
                for enlightenment and social change. Throughout the years we have created many programs that prepare our
                participants for the obstacles they will face and the leadership roles they will soon encounter. To improve
                the quality of life in our schools and communities we must create an environment that fosters respect, trust
                and cooperation. As parents we must take responsibility for the failures and anti-social behavior of our
                youth and young adults because "It Takes an Entire Village to Raise a Child." Through our program we will
                visit schools, youth centers, prisons and housing projects delivering a positive message while offering prizes,
                awards, grants, scholarships and other incentives that will improve the safety, academic and social
                development of our youth and young adults.
